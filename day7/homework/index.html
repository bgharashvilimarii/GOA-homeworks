    <h1>Three-toed sloth</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>The three-toed or three-fingered sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals.[2]<br> They are the only
         members of the genus Bradypus (meaning "slow-footed") and the family Bradypodidae. <br>
         The five living species of three-toed sloths are the brown-throated sloth,<br> the maned sloth, 
         the pale-throated sloth, the southern maned sloth, and the pygmy three-toed sloth.<br> In complete contrast 
         to past morphological studies, which tended to place Bradypus as the sister group to all<br>other folivorans,
          molecular studies place them nested within the sloth superfamily Megatherioidea,<br>
         making them the only surviving members of that radiation.
        </p>
 
          <h1>Evolution</h1>
          <p>A study of mitochondrial cytochrome b and 16S rRNA sequences suggests that B. torquatus diverged from B.<br> variegatus and B.
             tridactylus about 12 million years ago, while the latter two split 5 to 6 million years ago.<br> The diversification of B.
             variegatus lineages was estimated to have started 4 to 5 million years ago</p>
          <h1>Relation to the two-toed sloth</h1>
           <p>Both types of sloth tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, a particular species of three-toed<br> sloth and 
              a single species of the somewhat larger and generally faster-moving two-toed sloth will jointly predominate.<br> Although similar in overall appearance,
               the two genera are placed in different families. Recent phylogenetic analyses support the morphological<br> data from the 1970s and 1980s
                that the two genera are not closely related and that each adopted their arboreal lifestyles independently<br>.[6] From morphological studies,
                 from which ground-dwelling sloth taxa the three-toed sloths evolved or whether<br>they retained their arboreality from the last common ancestor of extant sloths is unclear.<br>
               The two-toed sloths were thought on the basis of morphology to nest phylogenetically <br>within one of the divisions of ground-dwelling Caribbean sloths.</p>

          <p>Understanding of sloth phylogeny has recently been greatly revised by molecular studies,<br>
                 based on collagen[3] and mitochondrial DNA[2] sequences. These investigations consistently place<br> three-toed sloths within Megatherioidea,
                  close to Megalonyx, megatheriids and nothrotheriids, and two-toed sloths close to mylodontids,<br> while moving the Caribbean sloths to a separate
                  basal branch of the sloth evolutionary tree.[3][2] These results provide further strong support for<br>the long-held belief that arboreality
                   arose separately in the two genera via convergent paths.<br>
